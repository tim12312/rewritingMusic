         What is this?
            </summary>
            First of all I'm a bit sorry and more importantly <b>I will take no responsebility if you destroy your Speakers or your hearing! So think about the frequencies first</b>
            <br><br> <p>Now about this "project", this is a simple approach to use rewriting rules to stepwise create "music". </p>
            <p>The whole thing is based on unique nodes (letters), each node needs to be assigned with a rule that defines how the node will be replaced in the next step,
             and each node is assigned to a frequents.(The most common frequencies can be looked up at: <a href="https://gist.github.com/marcgg/94e97def0e8694f906443ed5262e9cbb" target="_blank">here</a>)
            </p>
            With the step button you can run the rewriting model to create "music" and with the &#9654; button you can listen to your master pice. 
            Moreover you can select different Oscilators(only the once js includes), you can set the speed (not during a audio output), change the volume and loop the output.
            And if you really want to you can add multiply setups to create different "tracks" and paly them to gether.
